# Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bikeshare
Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)
## Introduction
In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company, Cyclistic. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: [Ask](https://github.com/SomiaNasir/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Cyclistic-Case-Study/blob/main/README.md#ask), [Prepare](https://github.com/SomiaNasir/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Cyclistic-Case-Study/blob/main/README.md#prepare), [Process](https://github.com/SomiaNasir/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Cyclistic-Case-Study/blob/main/README.md#process), [Analyze](https://github.com/SomiaNasir/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Cyclistic-Case-Study/blob/main/README.md#analyze-and-share), [Share](https://github.com/SomiaNasir/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Cyclistic-Case-Study/blob/main/README.md#analyze-and-share), and [Act](https://github.com/SomiaNasir/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Cyclistic-Case-Study#act).
## Ask
### Business Task
Devise marketing strategies to convert casual riders to members.
### Analysis Questions
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:  
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?  
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?  
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?  

Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
## Prepare
### Data Source
I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends from Jan 2022 to Dec 2022 which can be downloaded from [divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).  
  
This is public data that can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that we won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
